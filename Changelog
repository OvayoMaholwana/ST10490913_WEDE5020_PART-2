on the 18th of September I made a bunch of tweaks to the CSS to spruce up the design, make it more user-friendly, and ensure it works better across different devices. First off, I swapped out the original orange color (#e67e22) for a slightly darker shade (#d35400) in the header, footer, and buttons. This gives better contrast with white text, making things easier to read while keeping that warm, welcoming vibeâ€”perfect for a pet-themed site. I also added a subtle shadow to the .pet-card elements (box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)) to give them a bit of pop without going overboard. To make the layout feel less cramped, I bumped up the spacing in the main and .pet-gallery sections from 1rem to 1.5rem.For interactivity, I added some new tricks to make the site more engaging. Navigation links and buttons now have a :focus style with a brown outline (#8d5524) so keyboard users can navigate easily. Buttons also got a :active effect that slightly shrinks them (transform: scale(0.98)) when clicked, giving a nice tactile feel. I assumed the pet cards might be clickable, so I gave them :hover and :focus effects that lift them up a bit (transform: translateY(-5px)) with a stronger shadow for flair. Form fields (input, textarea, select) now highlight with the new orange color and a soft glow when focused, making forms more intuitive. To keep things smooth, I added transitions to buttons, pet cards, and form fields for a polished feel.On the responsiveness front, I threw in a new media query for tablets (max-width: 768px) to tighten up spacing (gap: 1rem), make pet cards a tad smaller (minmax(180px, 1fr)), and let the navigation wrap nicely with flex-wrap: wrap. Lastly, I switched the footer to position: sticky instead of position: relative so it stays at the bottom on longer pages, giving the layout a cleaner finish. These changes should make the site look sharp, feel interactive, and work great on any screen.
In my Part 1 of my POE the pictures and links were not working as mam pointed out on my feedback. I made some adjustment to my <img> code and links so that it just doesnt work when you run it but as you open them up on html.
26th of september I made changes to my github and removed all the work that was not responsive and replaced them with my new and improved work. References still stayed the same.
